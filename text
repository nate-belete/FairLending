Leveraging Data Analysis for Fraud Complaint Understanding
Overview
In our latest team meeting, we discussed strategies to better comprehend fraudulent complaints relative to industry peers using data analysis and modelling. The aim is to bolster our positioning with regulators and minimize the overstated notion of our company's CFPB fraud complaints.

Initial Findings
Our initial exploration into the data showcased prospective patterns of fraud. Similar language used in several complaints and particular aspects of encryption data signal a potential industry wide issue.

Implementation Plan
Upon gaining early insights, the team proposed several actions:

Model Development
This crucial part of our plan aims to improve our understanding and prediction capabilities. We are considering a two-fold approach:

Feature Engineering: This step will revolve around analyzing and structuring the complaint narratives into machine-readable inputs. Important characteristics, such as emotional tone, legal references, and use of capitalization, will be transformed into the model's input variables.
Supervised Machine Learning Model Creation: After the successful engineering of input features, we will construct an AI-powered model. This model's objective is to classify complaints into fraud and non-fraud categories based on the engineered features.
Benchmarking
As part of our understanding of the competitive landscape, we will compare our fraud complaint rates against other online-specific companies, like Chase or Capital One.

Model Validation
The final part of the plan involves testing the predictive model using our internal complaints data. After successful internal validation, we will consider adding external institutions data for further credibility.

Challenges and Considerations
Despite solid plans, several challenges were noted during the discussions:

Data Gaps: A lack of verifiable truth labels for external bank fraud cases.
Model Scope: A need to balance between model accuracy and functional direction guidance.
Language Patterns: Difficulty in distinguishing between emotional and rational tones.
Peer Comparison: Differentiating genuine complaints from fraud using statistical and predictive models.
Action Items
Several actions have been agreed upon to move the plan forward:

Proceed with the development of the supervised machine learning model.
Prepare a preliminary model to be reviewed within 1-2 weeks.
Look for additional data sources for validation if needed.
Prioritize the existing fraud project over secondary tasks, such as UAR risk management.
Regulatory Aspects
We plan to highlight the differences of our online-only model against traditional banks. Solid empirical data will demonstrate the higher rate of fraud complaints due to our business model, aligning our situation with broader industry trends.

Concluding Thoughts
The team is in agreement to set the course for the classification model development. Initial results will be ready for review, feedback, and following amendments. This initiative will allow us to present a clear, data-backed narrative to our regulators, providing necessary context to our higher fraud complaint rate.
